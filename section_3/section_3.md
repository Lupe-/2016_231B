Agenda for today
========================================================


- Linear regression function 

- Plotting the regression and the SD lines

- Multiple regression function

- Plotting multiple regression (3D!)




Let's start with an exercise in R 
========================================================


Find the equation for the regression line predicting weight from height in the dataset (the column labels are fweight and fheight). Use only the functions sd( ), mean( ), and var( ).  
You can assign intermediate values to r, sx, and sy if you want, but it’s not necessary.

(You will need the family.rda data set on bcourses, section_3 folder)


```r
load("~/Dropbox/classes/230A/problem set 1/family.rda")
```
